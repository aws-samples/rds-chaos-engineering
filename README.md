## RDS Chaos Engineering

Improve resilience of database workloads by using chaos engineering

Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand abnormal conditions in production. Recreating real-world failure conditions helps uncover hidden bugs as well as monitoring omissions and performance bottlenecks. This workshop  helps you build a standard architectural pattern for injecting failures and experiments for chaos engineering on Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS database instances to test for high availability. Learn how to use the AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS), a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments on AWS, to run complex scenarios with common system failures.
